This program just finds a route from a starting point (can be changed @line 14) to the end (given all the walls)
Optionality:
  \- "p" toggles if vertices are shown
  \- "n" toggles if distances are shown
  \- "s" toggles if the start+goals are shown
  \- "w" toggles if the walls are shown
  \- "r" toggles if the path (in blue) is shown
